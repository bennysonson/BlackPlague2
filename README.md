Group project game created using GameMaker Studio 2 that uses their custom "Game Maker" programming language. The game is a 2D action platformer that takes place during the black plague. We had a group of 3 where I was a lead programmer. I worked on player and enemy movement physics and logic, a camera to follow player, player health bar, power-up pickups, text for pickups and dialogue, the boss mechanics, a game over screen, sound and music, and various sprites.
